                      BBS per Verifier Linkability
            draft-kalos-bbs-per-verifier-linkability-latest

Abstract

   The BBS Signatures scheme defined in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures],
   describes a multi-message digital signature, that supports
   selectively disclosing the messages through unlinkable presentations,
   built using zero-knowledge proofs.  Each BBS proof reveals no
   information other than the signed messages that the Prover chooses to
   disclose in that specific instance.  As such, the Verifier (i.e., the
   recipient) of the BBS proof, may not be able to track those
   presentations over time.  Although in many applications this is
   desirable, there are use cases that require the Verifier be able to
   track the BBS proofs they receive from the same Prover.  Examples
   include monitoring the use of access credentials for abnormal
   activity, monetization etc.. This document presents the use of
   pseudonyms with BBS proofs.

   A pseudonym, is a value that will remain constant each time a Prover
   presents a BBS proof to the same Verifier, but will be different (and
   unlinkable), when the Prover interacts with a different Verifier.
   This provides a way for a recipient (Verifier) to track the
   presentations intended for them, while also hindering them from
   tracking the Prover's interactions with other Verifiers.

1.  Introduction

   The BBS Signature Scheme, originally described in the academic work
   by Dan Boneh, Xavier Boyen, and Hovav Shacham [BBS04], is a signature
   scheme able to sign multiple messages at once, allowing for
   selectively disclosing those message while not revealing the
   signature it self.  It does so by creating unlinkable, zero-knowledge
   proofs-of-knowledge of a signature value on (among other) the
   disclosed set of messages.  More specifically, the BBS Prover, will
   create a BBS proof that if validated by the Verifier, guarantees that
   the prover knows a BBS signature on the disclosed messages,
   guaranteeing the revealed messages authenticity and integrity.

   The BBS Proof is by design unlinkable, meaning that given two
   different BBS proofs, there is no way to tell if they originated from
   the same BBS signature.  This means that if a Prover does not reveal
   any other identifying information (for example if they are using
   proxies to hide their IP address etc.), the Verifier of the proof
   will not be able "track" or "correlate" the different proof
   presentations or the Provers activity via cryptographic artifacts.
   This helps enhance user privacy in applications where the Verifier
   only needs to know that the Prover is in possession of a valid BBS
   signature over a list of disclosed messages.

   In some applications, however, the Verifier needs to track the
   presentations made by the Prover over time, as to provide security
   monitoring, monetization services, configuration persistance etc.. To
   promote privacy reason, the Prover should not reveal or be bound to a
   unique identifier that would remain constant across proof
   presentations to different Verifiers and which could be used to link
   a Provers interactions with different Verifiers.

   The goal of this document is to provide a way for a Verifier to track
   the proof presentations that are intended for them, while at the same
   time not allowing the tracking of the Prover's activities with other
   Verifiers.  This is done through the use of Pseudonyms.  A pseudonym
   as defined by this document, is a value that will be constant when
   the Prover presents BBS proofs to the same Verifier, but will change
   when the Prover interacts with different recipients (with no way to
   link the two distinct pseudonym values together).  This is done by
   constructing the pseudonym value by combining a unique Verifier
   identifier with a unique Prover identifier.

   To avoid forging requests, the Prover's identifier will be signed by
   the same BBS signature used to generate the BBS proof.  This requires
   extending the BBS proof generation and verification operations with
   some additional computations that will be used to prove correctness
   of the pseudonym, i.e., that it was correctly calculated using the
   Verifier identifier, as well as, the undisclosed and signed Prover
   identifier.  The Prover identifier MUST be considered secret from the
   point of view of the Prover, since, if it is revealed, any entity
   will be able to track the Prover's activity across any Verifiers.

   This document will define new BBS Interfaces for use with pseudonyms,
   however it will not define new ciphersuites.  Rather it will re-use
   the ciphersuites defined in Section 6
   (https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-
   03.html#name-ciphersuites) of [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures]).

   Pseudonyms when used appropriately prevent verifiers from linking
   prover (proof) presentations between them.  We call this verifier-
   verifier collusion.  In addition pseudonyms can be used to prevent
   the signer from linking prover presentations to a verifier.  We call
   this verifier-signer collusion.  This second property is not always
   desirable in all use cases, for example to allow tracking of
   purchases a controlled substance by a prover by a central authority
   while preventing tracking by individual shops.

1.1.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used throughout this document:

   SK  The secret key for the signature scheme.
   PK  The public key for the signature scheme.
   L  The total number of signed messages.
   R  The number of message indexes that are disclosed (revealed) in a
      proof-of-knowledge of a signature.
   U  The number of message indexes that are undisclosed in a proof-of-
      knowledge of a signature.
   scalar  An integer between 0 and r-1, where r is the prime order of
      the selected groups, defined by each ciphersuite (see also
      Notation (#notation)).
   generator  A valid point on the selected subgroup of the curve being
      used that is employed to commit a value.
   signature  The digital signature output.
   presentation_header (ph)  A payload generated and bound to the
      context of a specific spk.
   INVALID, ABORT  Error indicators.  INVALID refers to an error
      encountered during the Deserialization or Procedure steps of an
      operation.  An INVALID value can be returned by a subroutine and
      handled by the calling operation.  ABORT indicates that one or
      more of the initial constraints defined by the operation are not
      met.  In that case, the operation will stop execution.  An
      operation calling a subroutine that aborted must also immediately
      abort.

1.2.  Notation

   The following notation and primitives are used:

   a || b  Denotes the concatenation of octet strings a and b.
   I \ J  For sets I and J, denotes the difference of the two sets i.e.,
      all the elements of I that do not appear in J, in the same order
      as they were in I.
   X[a..b]  Denotes a slice of the array X containing all elements from
      and including the value at index a until and including the value
      at index b.  Note when this syntax is applied to an octet string,
      each element in the array X is assumed to be a single byte.
   X[-1]  Denotes the last element of the array X
   range(a, b)  For integers a and b, with a <= b, denotes the ascending
      ordered list of all integers between a and b inclusive (i.e., the
      integers "i" such that a <= i <= b).
   length(input)  Takes as input either an array or an octet string.  If
      the input is an array, returns the number of elements of the
      array.  If the input is an octet string, returns the number of
      bytes of the inputted octet string.

   Terms specific to pairing-friendly elliptic curves that are relevant
   to this document are restated below, originally defined in
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves].

   E1, E2  elliptic curve groups defined over finite fields.  This
      document assumes that E1 has a more compact representation than
      E2, i.e., because E1 is defined over a smaller field than E2.  For
      a pairing-friendly curve, this document denotes operations in E1
      and E2 in additive notation, i.e., P + Q denotes point addition
      and x * P denotes scalar multiplication.
   G1, G2  subgroups of E1 and E2 (respectively) having prime order r.
   GT  a subgroup, of prime order r, of the multiplicative group of a
      field extension.
   e  G1 x G2 -> GT: a non-degenerate bilinear map.
   r  The prime order of the G1 and G2 subgroups.
   BP1, BP2  base (constant) points on the G1 and G2 subgroups
      respectively.
   Identity_G1, Identity_G2, Identity_GT  The identity element for the
      G1, G2, and GT subgroups respectively.
   hash_to_curve_g1(ostr, dst) -> P  A cryptographic hash function that
      takes an arbitrary octet string as input and returns a point in
      G1, using the hash_to_curve operation defined in
      [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve] and the inputted dst as the domain
      separation tag for that operation (more specifically, the inputted
      dst will become the DST parameter for the hash_to_field operation,
      called by hash_to_curve).
   point_to_octets_g1(P) -> ostr, point_to_octets_g2(P) -> ostr  returns
      the canonical representation of the point P for the respective
      subgroup as an octet string.  This operation is also known as
      serialization.
   octets_to_point_g1(ostr) -> P, octets_to_point_g2(ostr) -> P  returns
      the point P for the respective subgroup corresponding to the
      canonical representation ostr, or INVALID if ostr is not a valid
      output of the respective point_to_octets_g* function.  This
      operation is also known as deserialization.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Key Concepts

   A _pseudonym_ will be cryptographically generated for each prover-
   context of usage pair.  Its value is dependent on a pseudonym secret
   (nym_secret) and a context identifier (context_id).

3.1.  Context Identifier

   The Context Identifier (context_id) is an octet string that
   represents a specific context of usage, within which, the pseudonym
   will have a constant value.  Context Identifiers can take the form of
   unique Verifier Identifiers, Session Identifiers etc., depending on
   the needs of the application.  Verifiers will be able to use the
   Pseudonym values to track the presentations generated by a Prover,
   using the same signature, for that specific context.

3.2.  Pseudonyms

   The _pseudonym_ is a cryptographic value computed by the prover based
   on the nym_secret and the context_id.  At a high level this is
   computed by hashing the context_id to the elliptic curve group G1 and
   then multiplying it by the nym_secret value.  See Section Section 4
   for details.  The Pseudonym is sent to a verifier along with the BBS
   proof.

   This document defines a pseudonym as point of the G1 group different
   from the Identity (Identity_G1) or the base point (BP1) of G1.  A
   pseudonym remains constant for the same context, when combined with
   the same signature, but is unique (and unlinkable) across different
   contexts.  In other words, when the Prover presents multiple BBS
   proofs with a pseudonym to a Verifier, the pseudonym value will be
   constant across those presentations, if the same context_id value is
   used.  When presenting a BBS proof with a pseudonym to a different
   context, the pseudonym value will be different.  Note that since
   pseudonyms are group points, their value will necessarily change if a
   different a ciphersuite with a different curve will be used.
   Serialization and deserialization of the pseudonym point MUST be done
   using the point_to_octets_g1 and octets_to_point_g1 defined by the
   BBS ciphersuite used (see Section 6 (https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/
   draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-03.html#name-ciphersuites) of
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures]).

   This document specifies pseudonyms to be BBS Interface specific (see
   Section TBD of [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures] for the definition of
   the BBS Interface).  It is outside the scope of this document to
   provide a procedure for "linking" the pseudonyms that are used by
   different Interfaces or that are based on different ciphersuites.  An
   option is for the Prover to present both Pseudonyms with the relevant
   BBS proofs to the Verifier, and upon validation of both, the Verifier
   to internally link the 2 pseudonyms together.

3.3.  Mapping Messages to Scalars

   Each BBS Interface defines an operation that will map the inputted
   messages to scalar values, required by the core BBS operations.  Each
   Interface can use a different mapping procedure, as long as it
   comforts to the requirements outlined in
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures].  For using BBS with pseudonyms, the
   mapping operation used by the interface is REQUIRED to additionally
   adhere the following rule;

   For each set of messages and separate message msg',
   if C1 = messages_to_scalars(messages.push(msg')),
   and msg_prime_scalar = messages_to_scalars((msg')),
   and C2 = messages_to_scalars(messages).push(msg_prime_scalar),
   it will always hold that C1 == C2.

   Informally, the above means that each message is mapped to a scalar
   independently from all the other messages.  For example, if a =
   messages_to_scalars((msg_1)) and b = messages_to_scalars((msg_2)),
   then (a, b) = messages_to_scalars((msg_1, msg_2)).  Its trivial to
   see that the messages_to_scalars operation that is defined in
   Section TBD of [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures], has the required
   property.  That operation will be used by the Interface defined in
   this document to map the messages to scalars.  Note that the above
   operation (and hence the defined by this document Interface), only
   accepts messages that are octet strings.

4.  Pseudonym Calculation Procedure

   The following section describes how to calculate a pseudonym from a
   secret held by the Prover and the public context unique identifier.
   The pseudonym will be unique for different contexts (e.g., unique
   Verifier identifiers) and constant under constant inputs (i.e., the
   same context_id and nym_secret).  The context_id is an octet string
   representing the unique identifier of the context in which the
   Pseudonym will have the same value.  The nym_secret value is a scalar
   calculated from secret input provided by the Prover and random (but
   not secret) input provided by the Signer.  This will guarantee
   uniqueness of the nym_secret between different signatures and users.

   Pseudonym = hash_to_curve_g1(context_id) * nym_secret

   Additionally, the nym_secret value will be signed by the BBS
   Signature.  This will bind the Pseudonym to a specific signature,
   held by the Prover.  During proof generation, along the normal BBS
   proof, the Prover will generate a proof of correctness of the
   Pseudonym, i.e., that it has the form described above, and that it
   was constructed using a nym_secret signed by the BBS signature used
   to generate that proof.

5.  High Level Procedures and Information Flows

   To prevent forgeries in all cases all BBS messages are signed with
   the inclusion of some form of the provider pseudonym secret
   (nym_secret).  In addition the pseudonym is always computed by the
   prover and sent with the proof to the verifier.  While two different
   variations of signature and proof generation are given below based on
   the previously discussed unlinkability requirements there MUST be
   only one verification algorithm for the verifier to use.

   1.  The Prover computes their input for the nym_secret (called
       prover_nym) and retained for use when calculating the nym_secret
       value.
   2.  The Prover will wrap up in a cryptographic commitment using the
       _Commit_ procedures of Blind BBS the messages they want to
       include in the signature (committed_messages) and the prover_nym
       value, generating a commitment_with_proof and a
       secret_prover_blind.
   3.  The commitment_with_proof is conveyed to the signer which then
       uses the signing procedures in Section Section 6.1 to create a
       BBS signature and their input for the nym_secret value, called
       signer_nym_entropy.  They will convey both to the Prover.
   4.  On receipt of the signature and the signer_nym_entropy value, the
       Prover verifies the signature using the procedure of section
       Section 6.1 and calculates the nym_secret value by adding their
       prover_nym secret and the provided signer_nym_entropy values.
   5.  The Prover computes the _pseudonym_ based on the nym_secret and
       the pseudonym's context identifier context_id.
   6.  The Prover generates a proof using nym_secret,
       secret_prover_blind, signature, messages, committed_messages and
       the indexes of the messages to be reveled from those two lists
       (i.e., disclosed_indexes and disclosed_committed_indexes) using
       the procedures of Section Section 6.2.
   7.  The Prover conveys the proof and Pseudonym to the verifier.  The
       verifier uses the procedure of Section Section 6.3 to verify the
       proof.

6.  BBS Pseudonym Interface

   The following section defines a BBS Interface that will make use of
   per-origin pseudonyms where the nym_secret value is only known to the
   prover.  The identifier of the Interface, api_id, is defined as
   ciphersuite_id || H2G_HM2S_PSEUDONYM_, where ciphersuite_id the
   unique identifier of the BBS ciphersuite used, as is defined in
   Section 6 (https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-
   signatures-03.html#name-ciphersuites) of
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures]).

   The prover create a nym_secret value and keeps it secret.  Only
   sending a commitment with the proof of the nym_secret that the signer
   will used when creating the signature.

6.1.  Signature Generation and Verification with Pseudonym

6.1.1.  Commitment

   This section will describe the steps with which the Signer will
   generate a blind signature over an array of messages provided (and
   committed) by the Prover (committed_messages) and a pseudonym secret
   prover_nym, also chosen by the Prover.  During signature generation,
   the Signer will provide their own randomness into the pseudonym
   secret.  This will ensure that the pseudonym secret will always be
   unique, among different signature generation events.

   This section will provide a high level description of the required
   operations, by detailing the modifications required in the relevant
   BBS blind signature operations, to also consider the use of
   pseudonyms.  The full formal description of the operation can be seen
   at Appendix.  We will reference those operations where appropriate in
   this section.

   Initially, the Prover will chose a set of messages committed_messages
   that they want to be included in the signature, without reveling them
   to the Signer.  They will also choose their part of the pseudonym
   secret prover_nym as a random scalar value.

  1. committed_messages.append(prover_nym)
  2. (commitment_with_proof, secret_prover_blind) = Commit(
                                                     committed_messages,
                                                     api_id)
  3. convey commitment_with_proof to Signer.

6.1.2.  Blind Issuance

   The Signer generate a signature from a secret key (SK), the
   commitment with proof, and optionally over a header and vector of
   messages using the BlindSign procedure from
   [I-D.kalos-bbs-blind-signatures], substituting the call on the
   B_calculate of step 6, with the call to B_calculate_with_nym defined
   in Section Section 6.1.2.1.  More specifically, to issue a blind
   signature over a pseudonym, the Issuer will use BlindSign from
   [I-D.kalos-bbs-blind-signatures], substituting steps 6, 7 and 8 with
   the following three steps

6. res = B_calculate_with_nym(generators, commit,
                                  blind_generators[-1], message_scalars)
7. if res is INVALID, return INVALID
8. (B, signer_nym_entropy) = res

   Lastly, the return statement of BlindSign should be updated to return
   the signer_nym_entropy value, returned by the call to the B_calculate
   operation.

   The complete operation is defined in Appendix Appendix B.1.

6.1.2.1.  Calculate B

   The B_calculate_with_nym operation is defined as follows,

   (B, signer_nym_entropy)  = B_calculate_with_nym(generators,
                                                   commitment,
                                                   nym_generator,
                                                   message_scalars)

   Inputs:

   - generators (REQUIRED), an array of at least one point from the
                            G1 group.
   - commitment (REQUIRED), a point from the G1 group
   - nym_generator (REQUIRED), a point from the G1 group
   - message_scalars (OPTIONAL), an array of scalar values. If not
                                 supplied, it defaults to the empty
                                 array ("()").

   Deserialization:

   1. L = length(messages)
   2. if length(generators) != L + 1, return INVALID
   3. (Q_1, H_1, ..., H_L) = generators

   Procedure:

   1. B = Q_1 + H_1 * msg_1 + ... + H_L * msg_L + commitment
   2. signer_nym_entropy = get_random(1)
   3. B = B + nym_generator * signer_nym_entropy
   4. If B is Identity_G1, return INVALID
   5. return (B, signer_nym_entropy)

6.1.3.  Verification and Finalization

   The following operation both verifies the generated blind signature,
   as well as calculating and returning the final nym_secret, used to
   calculate the Pseudonym value during proof generation.

   This operation uses the BlindBBS.Verify function as defined in
   Section 4.2.2 (https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-kalos-bbs-blind-
   signatures-01.html#name-blind-signature-verificatio) of the Blind BBS
   document [BlindBBS]

5. return nym_secret

6.2.  Proof Generation with Pseudonym

   This section defines the ProofGenWithPseudonym operations, for
   calculating a BBS proof with a pseudonym.  The BBS proof is extended
   to include a zero-knowledge proof of correctness of the pseudonym
   value, i.e., that is correctly calculated using the (undisclosed)
   pseudonym secret (nym_secret), and that is "bound" to the underlying
   BBS signature (i.e., that the nym_secret value is signed by the
   Signer).

   Validating the proof (see ProofVerifyWithPseudonym defined in
   Section 6.3), guarantees authenticity and integrity of the header,
   presentation header and disclosed messages, knowledge of a valid BBS
   signature as well as correctness and ownership of the pseudonym.

   To support pseudonyms, the ProofGen procedure will be extended to
   accept the pseudonym secret nym_secret, as well as the context
   identifier context_id, which the pseudonym will be bounded to.  The
   nym_secret scalar value should be added to the
   committed_message_scalars list computed in ProofGen.  More
   specifically, step 4 of the ProofGen Procedure, defined in
   Section TBD will be substituted with the following step

4.  committed_message_scalars
            .append(BBS.messages_to_scalars(committed_messages, api_id))
            .append(nym_secret)

   This operation makes use of CoreProofGenWithPseudonym as defined in
   Section 7.1.

   Further more, the call to the BBS.CoreProofGen operation at step 10
   of the BlindProofGen Procedure will be substituted with a call to
   CoreProofGenWithNym operation, defined in Section Section 7.1.  More
   specifically, step 11 of BlindProofGen will be substituted by the
   following step.

11. proof = CoreProofGenWithNym(PK,
                                signature,
                                generators.append(blind_generators),
                                header,
                                ph,
                                context_id,
                                message_scalars.append(committed_message_scalars),
                                indexes,
                                api_id)

   The ProofGenWithPseudonym operation is described in detail in
   Appendix Appendix B.2

6.3.  Proof Verification with Pseudonym

   This operation validates a BBS proof with a pseudonym, given the
   Signer's public key (PK), the proof, the pseudonym, the context
   identifier that was used to create it, a header and presentation
   header, the disclosed messages and committed messages as well as the,
   the indexes those messages had in the original vectors of signed
   messages.  Validating the proof also validates the correctness and
   ownership by the Prover of the received pseudonym.

   To support pseudonyms, the BlindProofVerify procedure will be
   extended to accept the pseudonym value Pseudonym, as well as the
   context identifier context_id, which the pseudonym is bounded to.
   Additionally, the call to the BBS.CoreProofVerify operation at step
   9, will be replaced with a call to the core proof verification
   operation with pseudonyms defined in this document, i.e., of
   CoreProofVerifyWithPseudonym as defined in Section 7.2.

   More specifically, step 9 of the BlindProofVerify Procedure will be
   replaced with the following step,

9.  result = CoreProofVerifyWithPseudonym(
                                    PK,
                                    proof,
                                    Pseudonym,
                                    context_id,
                                    generators.append(blind_generators),
                                    header,
                                    ph,
                                    message_scalars,
                                    indexes,
                                    api_id)

   The ProofVerifyWithPseudonym operation is described in detail in
   Appendix Appendix B.3.

7.  Core Operations

7.1.  Core Proof Generation

   This operations computes a BBS proof and a zero-knowledge proof of
   correctness of the pseudonym in "parallel" (meaning using common
   randomness), as to both create a proof that the pseudonym was
   correctly calculated using an undisclosed value that the Prover knows
   (i.e., the nym_secret value), but also that this value is "signed" by
   the BBS signature (the last undisclosed message).  As a result,
   validating the proof guarantees that the pseudonym is correctly
   computed and that it was computed using the Prover identifier that
   was included in the BBS signature.

   The operation uses the BBS.ProofInit and BBS.ProofFinalize operations
   defined in Section 3.7.1 (https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-
   cfrg-bbs-signatures-07.html#name-proof-initialization) and
